# 🐍 Snake Game 

A simple implementation of the **classic Snake Game** using Python and the `curses` library.  
This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to practice logic, input handling, and working with external libraries.

- Eat the food (`π`) to grow longer.
- Game over if the snake hits the wall or itself.
