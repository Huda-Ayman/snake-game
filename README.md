# 🐍 Snake Game (Python + Curses)

A simple implementation of the **classic Snake Game** using Python and the `curses` library.  
This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to practice logic, input handling, and working with external libraries.

## 🚀 Features
- Snake moves with arrow keys (⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️).
- Eat the food (`π`) to grow longer.
- Game over if the snake hits the wall or itself.
- Real-time gameplay with keyboard input.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- `curses` library (comes pre-installed on Linux/Mac. For Windows: install `windows-curses`)

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```
